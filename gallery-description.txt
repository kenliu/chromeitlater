This is an unofficial client for Read it Later (http://www.readitlaterlist.com). Read it Later (RIL) is a web site that saves pages for you to read later from the same computer or another computer. This plugin saves pages directly to the RIL web site by clicking a button in the browser.

This extension currently supports the following features:
- Add page to RIL using popup
- Add page to RIL instantly (one click to save a page)
- Close current tab immediately after adding page  

You'll need to set up a Read it Later account before using this extension. Once you have an account, be sure to set up the Read it Later username and password in the extension options screen. (Right-click the blue ChromeItLater button for the options screen.)

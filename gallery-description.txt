posthoc is an unofficial client for Read it Later (http://www.readitlaterlist.com).

posthoc is designed for speed. Save your pages and move on.

Read it Later (RIL) is a web site that saves pages for you to read later from the same computer or another computer.

This extension features:
- Save page to RIL using popup
- Save page to RIL instantly (one click to save a page)
- Close current tab immediately after saving page
- Save instantly by right-clicking on a page or link (NEW)
- View list of recently saved pages (NEW)

*** Security notice for people who are upgrading from 0.2.3 ***
Chrome automatically warns you and disables the extension because the new version requires additional access for right-click context menus, favicons (site icons), and desktop notifications. None of these gives the extension additional access to your personal data and are no cause for concern.

You'll need to set up a Read it Later account before using this extension. Once you have an account, set up the Read it Later username and password in the extension options screen. (Right-click the blue posthoc icon to get to the options screen.)
